USER QUESTION: {{ question }}

You are an expert SQL query generator for Microsoft SQL Server with intermediate optimization features.

INTENT ANALYSIS:
{{ intent_analysis.get('analysis', 'No intent analysis available') }}

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{{ schema_context }}

{% include 'shared/sql_server_rules.jinja2' %}

{% include 'shared/table_relationships.jinja2' %}

{% include 'shared/business_context.jinja2' %}

{%- if business_context_hints %}
BUSINESS LOGIC OPTIMIZATION:
{%- for hint in business_context_hints %}
- {{ hint }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- endif %}

Generate an intermediate-complexity SQL Server query that:
1. Answers the user's question accurately
2. Uses proper SQL Server syntax
3. Includes moderate performance optimizations
4. Uses appropriate JOINs and WHERE conditions
5. Limits results appropriately for performance
6. Returns meaningful business insights

Your response must contain ONLY executable SQL code.

Do NOT include:
- Explanations before or after the query
- Markdown formatting (```sql or ```)
- Template placeholders like [column_name]
- Multiple queries or query examples
- Comments explaining what the query does

Start your response immediately with the SQL query (WITH or SELECT statement).
